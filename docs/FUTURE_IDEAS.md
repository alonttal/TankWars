# Future Ideas

## Weather Gameplay Impact
- Rain could make terrain slippery (ants slide on slopes)
- Snow could slow ant movement speed
- Wind gusts that change mid-flight during storms

## Visual
- Dust/debris particles kicked up from explosions and terrain destruction
- Ant victory/defeat animations at game end

## Weapons
- Airstrike (select a target area, bombs drop from the sky)
- Teleport (move your ant to a clicked location)
- Landmine (place and it triggers when an enemy walks near)
- Homing missile (slower but tracks nearest enemy)

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Fall damage when ants drop from a height after terrain is destroyed beneath them
- Crates that drop from the sky between turns with random weapons/powerups
- A rope/grappling hook for movement across the terrain

## Game Modes
- Sudden death (after N turns, something dramatic happens - rising water, shrinking map)
- 1v1 mode with fewer ants for quicker games

## Quality of Life
- Sound effects and music
- Replay of the last shot
